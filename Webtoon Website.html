  <h3>What is Webtoon?</h3>
  <p>Webtoon is an app and website that allows artist from all around the world to post their stories and illustrations. 
Posting stories and creating an account is free of charge and only takes a matter of minutes. 
Once you have account, you can see the thousands of stories that have been posted ranging from romance to horror. 
</p>
<h3>History</h3>Webtoons are a type of digital comic that originated in South Korea. While webtoons were mostly unknown outside of the country during their inception, there has been a surge in popularity internationally thanks in part to most comics being read on smartphones and computers now due to the popularity increase. Webtoon was originally a Korean website called "Naver". Webtoon has three languages that you can read in. 
</p>
<h3>About</h3>You can read webtoons that were originally written in a different language on the fan translation page. Webtoon also hosts contests where writers and artists can submit their works in order to earn a spot on the discover page. If an artist's Webtoon gets featured, they get paid for their work.
</p>
<h3>Recommendations</h3>On this website I will provide some Webtoons that I think are amazing reads. These recommendations are not for everyone and may not like my choices. I am also only walking about three different geres, but there are many more including comedy, action, and horror. Webtoon is a very large platform that had millions of stories, so even if you don't enjoy the stories listed, I'm sure you'll find a story that you will fall in love with and get addicted to.

<div id="Romance" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Romance</h3>
  <p>There are quite some Webtoons in the romance genre. Most of the romance stories are also adventure or fantasy, so it's hard to categorize a story as only romance. There is romance in almost any Webtoon that you can find, so it’s hard to give such recommendations. There are some Webtoons that I think have amazing romantic story lines and these are the ones that I am going to list. The romance stories I recommend are Siren’s Lament, Lore Olympus, Edith, Unlovable Replacement, Untouchable, Where Tangents Meet, and Always Human. 
  </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>My favorite of the seven is Siren’s Lament. Siren is a combination of all drama, fantasy, and romance, which is why it is one of my favorite Webtoons. It follows a young woman with a broken heart. When a Siren bestows his kiss on her, they share the curse of The Poseidon. Every time they go into water they turn into a siren. The romance of the story comes from the love triangle from the woman, her childhood crush, and the siren that cursed her. With the secrets of the sea unraveling every episode and the fight against the great curse, the Webtoon is strong with 121  chapters and is still as addicting as ever. The artist of Siren’s Lament is the same artist as the completed, Where Tangents Meet. With WTM made in 2015 and SL in 2016, it is amazing to see the improvement that the artist has gone through over the years. </p>

<div id="Fantasy" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Fantasy</h3>
  <p>Fantasy in Webtoon is an adventure on its own. There is a sea of imagination that is put into these Webtoons. There is everything from sirens to shape-shifting wolves. The titles I would recommend when looking for an escape from reality are unOrdinary, Empyrea, DICE, Freaking Romance, and Tower of God. My favorite from this list is unOrdinary.
  </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>UnOrdinary takes place in a world where most of the population has powers. The story follows a boy without powers making his way through a highschool ruled by the students with the greatest abilities. When his best friend finds herself in some trouble, he is forced to go into a dark state of mind where he is forced to face his past. The story shows an interesting play on society today and how power rules all. The story doesn't' have much romance, but instead has more action and mystery scenes. This story in one of my first Webtoons and is one of the reasons that I'm addicted to it today. UnOrdinary has characters and a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat and asking for more. This series has incredible art and an even more incredible story line with many twists and turns with its 118 chapters.</p>

<div id="Drama" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Drama</h3>
  <p> Drama Webtoons can involve many different aspects. They can include a mixture of fantasy, romance, and comedy all into one piece of art. Drama Webtoons may be a little cringey at the start, but they end up giving you a wonderful story, plus beautiful art of course. Some Webtoons that I would recommend for the drama category are I Love Yoo, True Beauty, Sub Zero, Age Matters, and Let's Play.
  </p>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>I Love Yoo is my favorite drama Webtoon because it shows you the real hard knock life of a teenage girl that gets mixed up in the drama of two billionaire brothers. She faces high school exams, financial issues, and family drama with her father that make her break down and want to give up until she meets the brothers. She has to fight through the constant drama that surrounds her every step of the way. Although the story doesn't progress very quickly, this Webtoon is definitely worth the read. The readers become apart of her journey towards happiness in its short 80 episodes. </p>
